# projects
A current project I am working on is creating a video game with the unity engine. This game will look similar to the board game called 'Risk' but will not use the turn-based system or the dice roll system. This will be a real-time multiplayer game where different player factions can fight for total domination or make pacts and diplomacies to divide and conquer.

# License
For this project the main license need is a copright license. This will ensure that no other developers can dublicate my work and show it as their own.
